Nicely written article by someone who used ML to predict the output of Xorshift128+ (a ubiquitous random number generator, for example, it's typically how math.random is implemented in javascript). I already knew this but Jesus, on some level ml really is just vibes. also, it's nice to see someone describe a problem space so well.

Wow! Chicago is beautiful. It's interesting that they have strong regulations against building signage there (probably in many other cities too). Architecture/city planning seems to be one area where laws DO make a big difference no matter how rich you are.

what we all knew that gdpr is not stopping the data harvesters. as someone that maintains hope that regulation can make a difference, its good to see we can at least get evidence on the law breakers. 

my impression and the general consensus seems to be that laws impact everyone except the biggest richest companies who just take the hit. so at least we already wiped out issues from 90% of companies. as for the other 10%, well, myself and others are waiting for the day when white collar crimes are punished the same as blue collar crimes of equal severity.

Looking for new text editor: Lite XL, Lapce, CudaText, Kate
I tried Lite XL; it's all very aesthetic but the search-replace UI is garbage and I couldn't get the plugin improvement for it working (within 15 minutes). 
I tried Kate; it's everything I wanted and more! To me it's notepad++ but with better file browsing/open files capability (to the point where I can turn off those pesky tabs for files)
