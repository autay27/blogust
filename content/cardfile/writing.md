> I want there to be fictional universes that talk about our own real life experiences. About the political problems we're facing, the geopolitical structures around us, the problems of the modern world, etc. Universes which don't leave us feeling numb, alone, and abandoned after we have finished exploring them. Universes which actually equip us with life tools and provide context for what's happening to us. Which give us the strength to carry on with our lives, instead of making us feel empty to the point where we say, "Oh my god, I want to go back to the land of the Elves, but I can't; I've already seen it all".
