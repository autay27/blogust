Vim - why use Vim? In my case, I tweak my writing a lot even if I am just writing a blog post or a piece of fiction. Moving the cursor with the mouse is ucomfortable and time consuming. Vim provides ways to move the cursor and chop and change text quickly without my fingers having to leave the keyboard.
