I've studied a little Japanese and Mandarin Chinese.

Learning radicals is highly advisable. It may seem silly to learn meanings of things which are not words, but it helps you build associations, mnemonics, and stories to remember the characters (without having to pay for wanikani to do it for you).

Although I haven't actively followed it, I like the idea behind [AJATT](http://www.alljapaneseallthetime.com/blog/) which is an immersion-based language learning methodology.

## Japanese 

My main goal was reading comprehension. I "studied" for maybe 1.5 years. I would say I succeeded within that time, because reading Japanese posts on social media, and partially reading the dialogue in comics and games to understand what they are talking about, became very enjoyable. So, I would recommend this to route to other hobbyists. However, you will not build any speaking skills.

### Resources

Tae Kim's Guide to Japanese Grammar - It's notoriously very simple but gets you parsing sentences and conjugations.

Anki - radicals and then the JP Core 10000 

maggiesensei.com (further in the archive are some nicely explained grammar lessons, and they all had cute pet photos!)

jisho.org

Yomiwa - for optical recognition, good for games etc where there is no copy and paste.

Kanjitomo - Best optical recognition software I could find back in ~2018, Windows only. I used it to read manga.


## Mandarin Chinese (Traditional)

I tried to study Chinese many times but it never worked out because there is no Chinese media I am really interested in, nor could I find a lot of people to follow posting in (Traditional) Chinese. However, as you can expect, I learned Chinese very fast when I lived in Taiwan for a few months. I can speak in broken baby level Chinese now.

A key that I think a lot of beginners aren't taught is that it's nigh on pointless to try and identify the tone of a single syllable. Instead, learn about [tone pairs](https://www.hackingchinese.com/focusing-on-tone-pairs-to-improve-your-mandarin-pronunciation/).

### Resources

A general note - for any CN learning app, even if it seems to be for Simplified, take a look for an option to change the display to Traditional!

"A Course in Contemporary Chinese" textbooks - a bit slow, but provided some structure to my learning. (I don't recommend the anki decks you can find online for these books, they have a few mistakes). 

I read some of the Ninchanese Chinese Grammar app, and liked it, but it's in Simplified.

Anki - I had a personal deck to record words that I saw/looked up when I was out and about. I also had a deck of 6000 most common characters but used it less often. I already knew radicals from Japanese, and didn't bother learning Chinese meanings.

DuShu - A marvelous app for practicing reading, specifically its "read from clipboard" option. It generates a nicely laid out pronunciation guide and dictionary for the text with options to hide and reveal definitions/pronunciations so you can practice recall.

Hanping Lite dictionary - it was just the first one I installed.

Next time I study, I think I will learn from my time studying Japanese, and obsessively read a condensed grammatical summary of CN. (It may not be as helpful since Chinese is a lot less grammar heavy, but I think it's worth trying.) Also I would really throw myself into Chinese language ACG...

Another idea is to just take the hit, and learn Simplified characters due to the sheer increased availability of resources.
