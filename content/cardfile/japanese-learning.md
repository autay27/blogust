## Japanese

My main goal was reading comprehension. I "studied" for maybe 1.5 years. I would say I succeeded within that time, because reading Japanese posts on social media, and partially reading the dialogue in comics and games to understand what they are talking about, became very enjoyable. My production ability is zero though and I have no resources on this.

### Resources

Tae Kim's Guide to Japanese Grammar - It's notoriously very simple but gets you parsing sentences and conjugations.

Anki - radicals and then the JP Core 10000. I probably learned more vocabulary from trying to read fanart comics on twitter though.

maggiesensei.com (further in the archive are some nicely explained grammar lessons, and they all had cute pet photos!)

jisho.org

Yomiwa - app for optical recognition, good for phone games etc where there is no copy and paste.

Kanjitomo - Best optical recognition software I could find back in ~2018, Windows only. I used it to read manga.
