Back [in 2023](/blog/little-things-in-oxford/) I mentioned that my favourite order at a bubble tea shop was black tea with QQ jelly and cheese foam. At the end of 2024 when I was discussing [Taiwanese teas](/blog/tw-2024-tea/) my favourite order had changed to Tieguanyin tea with cheese foam... the frivolous QQ jelly had been put aside so I could focus on the complex flavour of the tea.

Now there is a third challenger, something called 'Grape Cream' from ShangWei in Cambridge, which is a combination bubble tea shop and restaurant.

Let me list the elements of this drink from top to bottom of the cup:

- Cream (slightly more ice cream-y and less salty than your typical cheese foam)
- Grape flavour slushie
- Crushed real grapes
- Jelly (similar consistency to grass jelly, but it's clear and flavourless so I don't know what it is)

So abundant in textures and flavours, so thirst quenching, and at a very reasonable price!

I have been busy settling in since moving here and haven't had much inspiration for blogging. The thing I've been putting the most energy into is probably cooking and learning new recipes, but I don't want to write about that. For now, as a sign of life, have this silly update on a locally available drink.

While I'm on the topic of local stuff, here's a beautiful street sticker I saw on a walk. I like the combination of spray paint and stickering.
