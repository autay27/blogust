After less than a year in Cambridge I'm off to study abroad. I do plan to return here though. Considering this, I'm happy that I have settled in and formed a connection to the city by now, to the point where I have enjoyed discovering more obscure places and taking photos.

Recently a photographer friend of mine visited and we did a photo walk around Cambridge together. It was great to walk around chatting while looking for subjects, showing off our photos, trying each other's cameras out, etc. I like this format of social activity.

It really feels like proof I've settled in somewhere when I am happy showing it off to someone else!

Some favourite spots:

- The Fitzwilliam Museum - I go for its painting and ceramics collections.
- St Peter's Church - Not your typical UK church. Small and full of light. Kettle's Yard next door looks interesting but I haven't been yet.
- Burleigh Street - An outstanding collection of charity shops (the Oxfam on Bridge St is good too).
- Heartea Cherry - I posted about Shang Wei [before](/blog/drink-so-good), but for overall menu options and seating this is my bubble tea pick. I like their red bean topping.
- Cambridge Botanic Garden - The way they incorporate the scents of the plants as part of the aesthetic experience is something special.
- Cycling by the river to the north (Midsummer Common, Stourbridge Common, etc) - Cycling!!!
