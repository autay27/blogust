As I mentioned in my [last post](blog/i-got-a-dslr), I got a new camera, and this weekend I had my first chance to take it out on an adventure. I went for what I _thought_ would be a safe choice: the Southbank Centre, a place I find extremely beautiful and have already posted [some photos of](blog/london-visit-summer-2023) before.

It had rained earlier in the day, but when I arrived in the afternoon the sky was blue. Sunlight and puddles. Perfect conditions for photography I guess. I quickly spotted some other people who were out with their cameras. In fact, I (secretly) queued behind one of them to get access to The Perfect Puddle which had appeared in the perfect spot to take photos like this one:

I was disgruntled at the knowledge that this other person definitely took a very similar photo to mine, so I moved on quicker than I should have and didn't experiment to get the perfect shot. Apparently emotional maturity is also a skill needed for photography.


Apart from that... despite specifically mentioning it in my previous comments, I had forgotten just how hard it is to take good photos of the Southbank Centre! In hindsight, I retreated into more abstract photos as a result. I would have liked to document "what it was like there" a bit more.

After being thoroughly reminded of my limitations as a photographer and running out of steam, I headed across Waterloo Bridge and treated myself to some spicy pork dumplings at a restaurant called Xi Home. They were delicious!
