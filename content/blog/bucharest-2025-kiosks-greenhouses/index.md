This is part 2 of the photos from my trip to Bucharest; you can see part 1 [here](blog/bucharest-2025-food-hiking-city/). Although Romania is a former Soviet country and Bucharest had plenty of alluring Brutalist buildings, my photos of them did not turn out that special. Instead, let me show off some smaller things that made great subjects.

Firstly, free standing kiosks. In the UK I'm pretty sure we only have these for paying parking fees, so the variety here was a novelty to me.

This one at the airport bus stop was for STB, the Bucharest transport authority. I bought a 7 day travel pass here. There were also a lot of quirky free standing bank kiosks at the airport.

This was an obsolete one where you could top up your phone or buy a preloaded SIM card. It's a more "street photography" style photo which I took as a warm up and which I like all the layers of depth in; usually I find it a little weird to take photos of strangers, but when there's a lot of them together I feel like I am just capturing the overall scene and I'm slightly more okay with it.

When looking back at my photos of this trip, as always I was struck by the sheer sensory pleasure of sharp DSLR photos.

I almost called it tactile pleasure because what I really enjoy is seeing the textures of things in a way that my phone camera with its tiny little sensors can't capture. I'm delighted by the wetness of the water in these shots of the greenhouses at the Bucharest Botanical Garden.

Another thing that really benefits from camera photos over smartphone are people's faces; their skin and hair looks softer and the subtleties of facial features and expressions show up better. Unfortunately I won't be sharing the photos I took of my 'IRLs'... you can see how the camera captures the translucency of these leaves though.
