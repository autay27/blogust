## Pros

What got me interested in the first place: I can take better macro photos for my stationery blog. My phone camera really does not cut it for macro.

The urban landscape and other autobio photos I take for this blog should benefit too. The ones I take with my phone are great, but it bothers me that they get AI enhanced and what not. Even the 'Pro' shooting mode (which is a pain to use) does not give full control e.g. can't control aperture. More control = more true to my experiences and hopefully better looking.

The one I didn't realise going in: photography is widely respected. Most of my hobbies like drawing, writing or reading are difficult to share with others but photography is surprisingly a very "normie" hobby even though I don't see it as much different to drawing. I could talk to my granddad about his old film camera, my family are all interested to see mine, some of my coworkers are into photography and I can talk to them about it. It's a weird feeling for me (mostly I'm just like, where is the justice for art and writing!?).

At the same time, I'm able to exercise some of my favourite drawing skills (composition, colour choices) and avoid some of my least favourite (drawing details, getting things in proportion).

It gives some extra motivation to get out of the house and doesn't involve looking at a screen (aside from editing...).

And of course it's another chance to play with gadgets and learn things. Camera! Lenses! Photo editing software (Darktable which is FOSS)! Youtube videos about photography skills and history! My brain likes this kind of stimulation.

## Cons

The camera is large and heavy to walk around with (my camera and lens are both small and light and this still holds). You have to really commit to doing some photography if you want to do any at all. And even once you've done it there are more steps of friction between taking a photo and sharing it with anyone.

And, I don't know if I'm just in shock due to being a beginner to the hobby, but there is something psychologically taxing about editing. I feel happy taking a photo of abstract nonsense but then feel stressed while editing it, trying to imagine how another human being could possibly enjoy looking at it.

Photography is a very direct form of "sharing your vision with the world", there is not as much to hide behind as in drawing or writing. Even moreso than what I wrote about [my other creative activities](blog/creative-hermit) I need to make sure that I'm doing this for myself first.

There will be another blog post soon with more photos...
