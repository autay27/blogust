Thanks to my granddad's tendency of buying gadgets, I ended up with a secondhand Raynox 0.72x wide angle conversion lens. It came in a super retro looking box advertising that _DCR-720 Broadens your angle of view 38% more !_ I don't have any particular wish to get more wide-angle photos but I thought I might as well try it out.

The lens screws onto the front of a regular camera lens, but it's made for a 52mm thread and the only lens I have is the Canon 18-55 kit lens, which has a 58mm thread. I got a 58-to-52 step down converter on ebay for about Â£5 which worked fine.

As you can see, putting something smaller on the front leads to vignetting when zoomed all the way out, which I enjoy a lot. There is also some nice wide angle distortion.

Yes, yes, it's autumn, I admit it.

This is still South Wales. I think I took these pictures in a town and a village but I'm not sure if the village was just a neighbourhood, since there is nothing about it online.

The pictures which are _not_ zoomed all the way out could just as easily have been taken with the same lens without the converter on it; it would be more exciting if I was adding wide angle onto a lens that was already super wide angle, and if it were a prime rather than a zoom lens. But it was still fun.
