I have been thinking about how to improve my photo editing, and about editing as a conflict between pursuing what something was "really like" vs. creating an impact or mood. Of course the ideal is both, to portray the mood that you really felt, but at least for me it's rare to have a fully fleshed out feeling about these things (it's more like just a twinge), so feelings can't get me everywhere.

Anyway, I'm in Taipei right now. Here are four photos from around the CKS Memorial Hall. I tried to edit them to have a common thread between them.

{{< photofigure src="1.jpg" caption="A crossing by an elevator to the subway" >}}

{{< photofigure src="2.jpg" caption="The corridor inside the wall running around the grounds" >}}

{{< photofigure src="3.jpg" caption="View of one of the flanking buildings (the National Theatre?) from the gardens" >}}

{{< photofigure src="4.jpg" caption="The hall itself visible at the entrance of a residential complex across the road" >}}

I feel like what I am missing when editing is an idea of my end product or a specific style to have in mind. On Youtube I have been seeing these video tutorials on how to achieve a 'moody', 'dreamy', or 'clean' style or emulating a certain style of film, and they get great results. But my photos are of my life and I don't know what kind of style I want to apply to my life.
