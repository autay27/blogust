Recently I visited Wembley, specifically Ealing Road south of Wembley Central station. I was attending my coworker's Sikh wedding and this was the nearest place I could find to buy a salwaar kameez for the dress code. I didn't realise but this street is sometimes called 'Little India' and has loads of traditional clothing shops down it.

In the clothes shop I walked into, the salwar kameez were all being sold without the sleeves attached - I headed to a nearby tailor afterwards to have them measured, cut and sewn on in a few minutes, which was a cool first experience with a tailor.

Along the way, I was thirsty so I stopped at a cafe called Cha Sha, which is mostly what this post is about. I got their signature chai blend, which was super tasty, milky and nutty. Served in a clay cup (matka) with a very round lip; I am convinced that a rounded lip makes the drink tastier, it's the same with fancy porcelain cups that have a curved out rim.

When I was there they were playing music from a South Asian musical fusion TV show called "Coke Studio" which surprisingly is [a whole thing](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-india-61518339) which is merely sponsored by Coke. I just got a peek at the logo so I'm not sure which version of the show they were playing. I can't exaggerate how banger these songs are and they are available to listen on music streaming services e.g. [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kw4tT7SCmaY&list=PLlYsrzDvIU9Rl3KTGvX2tPr6yBwPPjaH0).

On the way home I happened to pass by a temple called Shri Sanatana Hindu Temple, which is apparently made all of limestone that was carved in India before being sent to the UK. It looked cool in such a different way to the temples and churches I'd seen before!
